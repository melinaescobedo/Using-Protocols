# Using-Protocols
Declaring a Swift Protocol 

## Protocol swift file
1.	An String attribute called item.
2.	An Int property called id, which can have nil as value.
3.	A function called toString with no input parameters and that returns a String that represents an object of the corresponding class that conforms to this protocol.

## Class swift file
That conforms the protocol and also the Equatable and Comparable protocols in Swift:
1.	Program an extension of this class. In the extension, program the necessary functions to conform to the protocols.

## Main swift file
1.	Declare an array of objects of your class.
2.	Construct at least five objects of your class, assigning values to the attributes of each object, and add each object into the array.
3.	Sort the array using the sort() Swift function for the arrays. 
4.	For each of the elements of the sorted array invoke their toString function and the other function that you defined.
